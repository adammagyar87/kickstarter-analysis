# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Provide a specific look at successful Kickstarter campaigns for similar projects as the clients. Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends. 
Broke data out into different sheets based on Louise's requests.
May, June, and July are good months to launch a theater campaign in the US. The median goal of a successful US theater kickstarter was $3000. 

## Analysis and Challenges
The outcomes of plays were broken down based on the launch date and the fundraising goals. The challenges were to separate the data based on the date launched which needed to be converted from a Unix style format. The categories dataset was combined in a Parent/Sub format and needed to be separated to focus the study on the clients project type.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The launch date analysis demonstrated a strong spike for successful campaigns that began in the month of May. June and July both outperformed all other months. This three month period would be a great window to aim for. Chart below:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The most successful campaigns in the plays subcategory had goals in the sub $5,000 range, with another spike in the $35,000 - $44,999 range. The client also expressed interest in plays from the GB region and was estimating Â£4,000 (~$5,500) for a goal and may want to reconsider that value based on these results. Chart below:

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
There is a large increase in the number of successful goals launched in May, followed by June then July. This 3 month window would be the ideal time to start the campaign. 
Campaigns starting in December had an almost 50% failure rate and would be the worst time to begin. 

The highest success rate based on goals occur under $15,000. The only other goals with an over 50% success rate were in the $35,000 - $49,999 range. 

This specific data set is for all plays and the client may get a better idea of success rates if we were to further break it down by similar genres. 

Further anaylsis could be to separate the data to the countries (US and GB) the client intends to stage their plays in.
